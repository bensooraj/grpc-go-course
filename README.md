This is me workign through the exercises of the O'Reilly course [gRPC [Golang] Master Class: Build Modern API and Microservices](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/grpc-golang-master/9781838555467) by [*Stephane Maarek*](https://github.com/simplesteph).

The MongoDB CRUD implementions are different than in the course. I guess the [mongo-go-driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver) package has been updated since this course was created.
